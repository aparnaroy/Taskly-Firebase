# Taskly

Taskly is a to-do app I built because most apps had too many features I didn’t need and missed the small ones I wanted. With simple, reorderable tasks, the ability to have multiple task lists, tags for labeling tasks, and a fun visual celebration upon task completion, Taskly focuses on what matters. Completed tasks stay on the screen so you can see what you've accomplished, and both light and dark modes ensure a comfortable experience, no matter your preference.
